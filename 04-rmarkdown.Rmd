# RMarkdown basics

# R Markdown (very briefly)

One of the benefits of RStudio is seamless integration of R Markdown.

Go to File > New File > R Markdown...

You will see options to create a Document, Presentation, Shiny, or From Template. The most common choice is to create a Document. Let's type "MMED501 R session 1" in the Title box and type your name in the Author box. Select the radio button for HTML under "Default Output Format" and click OK. 

A new file will open with .Rmd as the file extension. Go to File > Save and save this in the same location as the previous .R file we saved, with the filename "mmed501-rmd-session1.Rmd"

The top part of the file, between the two sets of ---, is called the yaml header. There are many options you can set here to format your document in specific ways, but it provides sensible and basic defaults. The important thing to know about the yaml is that spacing and returns are very important and a common source of error.

Next you'll see that the document has come pre-filled with some default information to get you started. The first thing you see starting with ```{r ...} is called a code chunk. This is where you will type the R code that you want to be executed. Below that you will see some text that will be printed to the resulting file. Text is based on markdown, so you can use any markdown formatting options for headers, bold, italic, etc.

Let's delete out the default text, leaving the top R chunk. This R chunk is telling R that we want our actual code to print to the file as well. To suppress code and only show the results of code, you can change this from `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)` to `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)`.

Now return two lines and go to Insert > R to insert a new R code chunk. Copy and paste our three lines of code there:

```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
mean(x)
hist(rnorm(100))
```

Return two more lines and type some text that you want to print.

You can also execute R code inline instead of in an R chunk by using `` `r knitr::inline_expr("expression")` ``, where expression is replaced by the code you want to evaluate.

Now, to generate the output, we can simply hit "Knit". A new window will pop up with the html output of your program. In this way you can create reproducible reports for all of your projects.
